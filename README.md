# WebApp Tutorial

Following a tutorial from YouTube to learn WebApp development, again. This time, may it work out mightily.

I am following a tutorial video series found on Youtube to use Google Action Scripts to build a "Web App". A Google Apps Script web app is an HTML GUI to wrap other Google Scripts. This allows them to be accessible from the web. At least, that is my goal. 
I will commit my code after every successful step, and every lesson chapter. Note that I am following the WebApp tutorial on YouTube located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRQvySxaCW0&list=PLv9Pf9aNgemt82hBENyneRyHnD-zORB3l

My ultimate intention is to create an application that can serve as GUI/Front end for an application that I am creating called 'RulesBot' which will automatically organize your gmail based upon pre-set rules.

## Part 1

**Step 1**

Basic setup. Created a script with 'doGet' function and an HTML file for output. Had the script display the HTML. Played with passing and logging parameters in the Get request.

**Step 2**

Playing with request parameters and logging.

**Step 3**

Added an HTML button, and JavaScript to handle it. Still not very complex, but I was happy it worked. Moving on!

** Step 4 **

Added an input box to accept "username" value. Passed it to server, and logged it.

** Step 5 **

Added code to write the "username" value captured from the input box to a Spreadsheet that we had just manually created. Now this is getting cool! We had just manually created the spreadhseet. In the code we accessed it by it's URL. Could have also accessed it by it's ID.

** Step 6 **

Added code to write current date and time to spreadsheet, along with username. Very cool.
